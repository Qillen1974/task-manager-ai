 Future Conversation Example

  When you come back later needing help:

  "Hi, I'm working on v1.0-stable of my TaskMaster application. I want to:
  - Create a deployment script for Ubuntu 22.04
  - Set up PostgreSQL and Node.js automatically
  - Configure the app to run on port 3000
  - Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

  Can you help me create the script?"

  I can then:
  1. Ask for confirmation of the version
  2. Reference the features we know are in v1.0-stable
  3. Ask about your VPS environment (OS, hosting provider, etc.)
  4. Create the appropriate installation script

  ---
  In summary: Just say "v1.0-stable" and I'll know exactly which version you mean! 🎯
